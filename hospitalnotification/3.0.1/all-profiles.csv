* history : the date that the history was assembled. This time would be used as the _since time to ask for subsequent updates
* searchset : the time that the search set was assembled. Note that different pages MAY have different timestamps but need not. Having different timestamps does not imply that subsequent pages will represent or include changes made since the initial query
